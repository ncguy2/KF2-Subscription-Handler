# KF2 Server Workshop Tool

A tool for managing a "Killing Floor 2" Server; mainly the custom maps that are added via Steam subscriptions.
Suggestions and pull-requests welcome. Take a look at "todo.txt" before, though.

### How to use
Download the released file(s) you want, and save it in the same folder as your KF2 Server (SteamCMD/KF2Server/).
