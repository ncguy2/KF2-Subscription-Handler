# KF2 Server Workshop Tool

A tool for managing a "Killing Floor 2" Server; mainly the custom maps that are added through Steam.

## How to use
Download the released file(s) you want, and save it in the same folder as your KF2 Server (SteamCMD/KF2Server/).
Everything else should be self-explanatory. If problems occur, you're free to contact me or send in a bug report.
I suggest checking "todo.txt" first, though. Some of those problems will be logged in there.
